      "Toxic waste can pollute groundwater, soil, surface water and air which can cause many problems for humans as well as for environmental health. Moreover, gases like CO2 and methane, which are a by-product in many production processes, have an adverse impact on our environment since these gases increase the speed of global warming."

      "One of the consequences of improper waste disposal is its effect on health, especially those living close to landfills or polluted areas. If waste is not disposed of appropriately, it can attract insects and rodents, which in turn can harbor parasites, worms, yellow fever, the plague and other serious conditions for humans. Also, there is a big risk for cancer if humans are exposed to hazardous waste which is burned without sufficient protection."

    description:
      "Incorrect waste disposal allows garbage to scatter and spread in bodies of water and on land. Animals suffer from the effects of pollution, especially those who consume waste, such as Styrofoam and plastic. Wildlife that feeds on plants close to contaminated spaces are more at risk of poisoning due to the toxins in the soil."

    description:
      "When an area has poor waste management, it’s less likely to attract any tourists or investors. The majority of people want to reside in a clean and healthy environment. If this isn’t possible, it’ll most likely halt growth for the city. If the landfill or waste disposal facilities are under poor management, it can cause the local economy to deteriorate over time as well, ultimately affecting the locals’ livelihood."

      "As waste decomposes, it can release gases that move up to the atmosphere and trap heat, leading to warmer climates. Greenhouse gases are one of the chief culprits behind the drastic weather changes occurring all over the world. From powerful storms, blistering heatwaves, and rising water levels, it has affected millions worldwide."
