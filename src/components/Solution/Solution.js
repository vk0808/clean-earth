        <p className="desc">
          Waste is everybody's responsibility. Solving waste disposal problem
          requires a large-scale continuous effort. Manufacturers need to take
          responsibility for their waste by operating in a
          <strong> circular economy</strong> as much as possible and find ways
          to adapt to modern tried and tested technologies to beyond
          conventional methods of producing products.
        </p>
        <p className="desc second-para">
          While consumer can also play a role in this circular economy by
          incorporating the 5R principles -
          <strong> Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Raise Awareness</strong>,
          whether at home or at work. This will not only reduce the amount of
          solid waste going to landfill, but turn waste into a resource & also
          save our fast depleting natural resources.
        </p>
        <p className="desc third-para">
          Municipal governments can also do their share by working with industry
          and other stakeholders to <strong>expand the types of wastes </strong>
          that can be handled by local facilities.
